# UI/UX Developer Code Test

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`  
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Assumptions & Decisions

- Used **Nuxt UI Pro** since the Figma design aligns with its components  
- First time using Nuxt UI Pro, so part of the time was spent understanding it  
- Some components were partially implemented due to time constraints  
- Added **light/dark mode toggle** for better user experience

## Dependencies Used

- Nuxt 3  
- Nuxt UI Pro  
- Tailwind CSS v4  
- SCSS  
- @nuxt/fonts (Manrope)  
- @nuxt/icons (Streamline Ultimate)

## Deployment

Deployment is not included as **Nuxt UI Pro** is a private module and cannot be used in public hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify without a valid license.
